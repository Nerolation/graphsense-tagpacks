# GraphSense Public TagPacks

This repository also provides a curated collection of TagPacks, which have been
collected from **public sources** either by the GraphSense team or from other
contributors.

For more details on TagPacks we refer to the
[TagPack-Tool repository](https://github.com/graphsense/graphsense-tagpack-tool)

## Collaborative Collection and Sharing of TagPacks

All TagPacks in this repository must fulfill the following criteria:

1.) None of the tags contains personally identifiable information (PII)

2.) All tags originate from public sources

3.) All tags provide a dereferenceable pointer (link) to their origin

If someone wants to create TagPacks not fulfilling these criteria, it is of
course possible to store them privately, e.g., on the local filesystem or a
local Git instance.
